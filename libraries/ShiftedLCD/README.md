= ShiftedLCD Library for Arduino =

Allows communication via SPI Bus with alphanumerical liquid crystal displays (LCDs). 
This library works with LCD displays that are modified to use 595 Shift Register (in this case 74HC595) pin compatible. 
You can easily add Shift Register to your LCD. Please refer below link for pinouts and modifing your LCD.

I had a spare 1602 LCD that laying around for a long time , bare LCD that you can connect it to your Arduino in parallel.
I wanted to reduce used pins, and I have already working on my other project featuring SPI bus, it was good practice to
use them together on SPI bus. Old Libraries that supports Register Shift IC did not satisfied my needs. So I forked Juan Hernandez's (juanh0238) work, and this Library was born.

This is SPI only library, parallel and other buses (I2C or 1Wire, etc) are not supported.

What Works

* It seems we can use all LiquidCrystal commands
* Hello World Example
* Concurrent SPI slaves
